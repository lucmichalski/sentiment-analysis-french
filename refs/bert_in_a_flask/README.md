# BERT & ALBERT  in a flask
This repo demonstrates how to serve both vanilla BERT and ALBERT predictions through a simple dockerized flask API. The repo contains implementation of both [google-research/bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert) and [google-research/ALBERT](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT) for multiclass classification purposes. Model implementation is based on [kpe/bert-for-tf2](https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2).

The code is written to be compatible with [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf), and [Docker>=19](https://docs.docker.com/). If you want to train with a GPU, you will also need to have `nvidia-container-toolkit` installed. Instructions on how to install this can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). The project uses the [Stackoverflow dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-workshop-examples/stack-overflow-data.csv) for demonstration purposes.
## NEWS
* **04-02-2020** - Now supports [google-research/ALBERT](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). Data and model loading has been simplified and improved.  
* **06-01-2020** - Codebase has been overhauled and ported to [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf). The implementation is now based on [kpe/bert-for-tf2](https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2).
* **25-10-2019** - Bugfixes. Code is now runnable, with a data example. Codebase still under construction, considering upgrading the project to TF 2.0
## USAGE
The most common docker commands used in this project, have been wrapped in `Makefile` targets for convenience. Training and API serving is executed in docker containers. The corresponding Dockerfiles are `Dockerfile_dev` for training/development and `Dockerfile_api` for the API. Building these can be achieved using the following targets.
```Make
make build_dev
make build_api
```
The development docker image uses [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and [boxboat/fixuid](https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid), to mount the local folder with proper permissions for easier development and debugging. The API docker image on the other hand copies the code in to the image, on build. This means you should rerun `make build_api` whenever you make changes to the serving code, or train a new model you want to serve.
### TRAINING
#### Pretrained models
A number of pretrained models from both [google-research/bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert) and [google-research/ALBERT](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT), are supported. Below are two lists of supported BERT and ALBERT models:
#### BERT

* [uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip)
* [cased_L-12_H-768_A-12](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/cased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip)

* [wwm_uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2019_05_30/wwm_uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip)
* [wwm_cased_L-24_H-1024_A-16](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2019_05_30/wwm_cased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip)
#### ALBERT
* [albert_base_v2](https://storage.googleapis.com/albert_models/albert_base_v2.tar.gz)
* [albert_large_v2](https://storage.googleapis.com/albert_models/albert_large_v2.tar.gz)
* [albert_xlarge_v2](https://storage.googleapis.com/albert_models/albert_xlarge_v2.tar.gz)
* [albert_xxlarge_v2](https://storage.googleapis.com/albert_models/albert_xxlarge_v2.tar.gz)

The training script automatically adapts to either type of model. Simply specify which pretrained model you want to use by changing the variable `model_name` in the file `src/train.py`. Accepted model values are the ones listed above, however they can also be found in `/src/utils/loader.py`.
#### Parameters
Below is a list of high level parameters, that can be adjusted in `src/train.py`. Notice the default values in `src/train.py` are given as an example, and should not be seen as optimal.

| Name              | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| batch_size        | Batch size used during training.              |
| max_seq_len       | Upper bound on the length of input sequences. |
| n_epochs          | Total number of epochs to run.                |
| max_learn_rate    | The upper bound on the learning rate.         |
| min_learn_rate    | The lower bound on the learning rate.         |
| warmup_proportion | Fraction of total epochs to do linear warmup. |

By default the learning rate used during training, is modelled to be linearly growing towards an upper bound until a given fraction of total epochs is reached, then it decays exponentially to a lower bound. If you do not wish to use this behaviour, remove the callback `learning_rate_callback` from the list of keras callbacks.
#### Running
To train the model run the following command:
```Make
make train TENSORBOARD_PORT=<PORT> GPU=<GPU>
```
Tensorboard is intialized during training in `models/trained`, and the port defaults to 6006. The `GPU` parameter which expects an integer (defaults to 1) specifies the GPU you want to use for training (only relevant if you have more than one GPU). This code is written for single GPU setups.

Model files and tensorboard logs are exported to a datetime stamped folder under `models/trained` during training. Furthermore a confusion matrix plot is generated and saved to this directory upon finishing training, which is calculated from the model performance on the test set.

#### Out of memory exceptions
Depending on your GPU hardware you might experience oom exceptions. To avoid this either reduce the `batch_size` or `max_seq_len` and/or choose a smaller pretrained base model.
### INFERENCE
To serve predictions, a minimal working example of a dockerized flask API is provided. 
The API loads the latest trained model, by looking in the file `models/latest_model_config.json`, which is overwritten everytime a new model is trained. Modify this file manually if you wish to use a specific model. 

The API can be booted up using the command:
```Make
make start_api api_port=<PORT>
```

Once the API container is running, requests can be made in the following form using the assigned API port:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '<JSON_OBJECT>' http://localhost:<PORT>/predict
```
The JSON object should have the following format. Notice the input is a list, making it possible to parse a list of input bodies:
```json
{
    "x": ["Should i use public or private when declaring a variable in a class?", "I get an ImportError everytime i try to import a module in my main.py script"]
}
```
The API does a minimum logging of each call made. The format of the logs is defined in `src/app.py`. Below is an example of a request log:
```json
{
    "endpoint": "/predict", 
    "response": {   
        "model": "BERT 2020-01-06 22:06:23 4b4e44b2", 
        "predictions": ["java", "python"], 
        "probabilities": [0.9852411150932312, 0.9999822378158569]
    }, 
    "status_code": 200, 
    "response_time": 0.48097777366638184, 
    "user_ip": null, 
    "user_agent": "curl/7.58.0"
}
```
